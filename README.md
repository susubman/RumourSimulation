# Rumour Simulation

A Java-based simulation that models the spread of fake news or rumours across a network of individuals. This is a basic academic-style project for understanding how information propagates in a connected system.

## 📁 Files

- `Main.java` - Entry point of the simulation
- `Network.java` - Handles the structure and logic of the social network.
- `Person.java` - Represents individuals in the network with behaviour for spreading or resisting rumours.
- `RumourSimulation.java` - Controls and runs the simumlation.
- `Stats.java` - Collects and displays statistics from each simulation run.

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Java 17 installed.

javac *.java
